ðŸ§  Wine Data Clustering using DBSCAN

This project applies the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to a wine dataset to explore natural groupings based on chemical composition. The notebook walks through data loading, preprocessing, scaling, and clustering, followed by visual analysis of the results.

Files included:

Winedata_DBSCAN.ipynb â€“ Jupyter notebook containing the full code and step-by-step explanation of the DBSCAN process.

wine-clustering.csv â€“ The dataset used for clustering, containing features such as Alcohol, Flavanoids, Proline, Color Intensity, and more.

Key highlights:

Data exploration and preprocessing for clustering.

Application of DBSCAN to identify dense clusters and outliers.

Visualization of clusters for better interpretation.

Comparison with other clustering approaches (optional if added later).

Goal:
To understand how DBSCAN groups similar wines without prior labeling and how density-based methods differ from centroid-based ones like K-Means.
